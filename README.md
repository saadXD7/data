Project Description
Electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing is a rapidly growing industry where minimizing production costs is a critical challenge. This project aims to optimize the manufacturing costs of EVs by leveraging data science techniques such as preprocessing, forecasting, and optimization. The solution integrates multiple datasets, including material prices, logistics costs, and production demand, to deliver actionable insights for cost-efficient production planning.

This end-to-end data science project is designed to solve real-world problems faced by the EV industry, such as managing volatile material costs and optimizing supplier allocations while meeting production demands.
